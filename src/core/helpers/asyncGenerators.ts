/**
 * Asynchronously yields values from an array of promises as they resolve, in the order they are fulfilled.
 * Promises resolving to `undefined` are skipped and not yielded.
 *
 * @template T - The type of values resolved by the promises.
 * @param promises - An array of promises that resolve to either a value of type `T` or `undefined`.
 * @returns An `AsyncGenerator` that yields values of type `T` as soon as their corresponding promises resolve.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const promises = [
 *     new Promise<number | undefined>(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 300)),
 *     new Promise<number | undefined>(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(undefined), 200)),
 *     new Promise<number | undefined>(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 100)),
 * ];
 *
 * for await (const value of resolveAndYield(promises)) {
 *     console.log(value); // Logs: 2, then 1
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * - This function uses `Promise.race` to process the promises as they resolve.
 * - Promises that resolve to `undefined` are ignored and not yielded.
 * - The function will continue until all promises in the input array are resolved.
 * - If a promise rejects, the rejection must be handled externally to prevent unhandled promise rejections.
 *
 * @throws This function does not handle rejected promises internally. Ensure that you handle rejections in the input promises, e.g., by using `.catch()` before passing them to this function.
