As Verity gladly 'does not implement a cryptocurrency nor does it resemble a
blockchain', it relieves as us of asking the stereotipical question:
*I have a blockchain, now what can I use it for?*

But still, let's collect some ideas:

- Microblogging
- Collection of billing data, e.g. from smart meters
- LoRa access point

## User growth strategies
### Microblogging
- Local community niches: Try to get a partnership with a local content provider
  and either an existing local community or a local authority, e.g. in Malta:
  concince MaltaToday to provide local news and MTA to let us post Verity QR codes
  in touristy areas, hotels, brochures, etc.

## Monetarisation strategies:

### Microblogging
We could try to usual combination of ads, paid featured posts, paid user
verification, but I'm not too confident in any of them and all of them basically
defeat the purpose of a decentralised network.

### Billing data / LoRa access point
- Sell keys to users, allow a certain amount of unsigned Cubes per key
  (positions us as a resilient alternative to AWS and all the other cloud
  providers, but impossible to beat them on price for the miniscule amount of
  data we offer and hard to convince users we're a safer choice than Amazon)
- Sell keys to IoT device makers, allow them a certain amount of unsinged Cubes per
  key
