# Whitepaper draft

You know, let's create a fancy whitepaper with lots of meaningless graphics
and stuff.

# Core Verity benefits

1. Serverless, i.e. no need for:
  - expensive managed hosting
  - service level agreements
  - overpaid DevOps dudes
1. High Availability out of the box
  - no server downtimes
  - no single point of failure
  - provider-redundant
  - globally geo-redundant
1. Offline-capable out of the box
  - Works on airplanes, automatically syncs on landing
  - Works on unstable connections, e.g. on board of trains
1. dDOS-resistant
  - adding additional nodes requires no setup effort, mitigation thefore cheaper than attack attempts
1. Scale as you grow
  - Start for free on our global public network
  - Use (and pay for) as many or as little nodes as you need
1. CDN included
  - Global presence even on the free tier
  - As you grow, book your own private nodes in any region worldwide
  - Or operate your own with our easy to deploy toolkit
1. Privacy built-in
  - All data encrypted in transit
  - Encryption at rest whenever you want it
  - If desired, data can even be encrypted in a way that is not readable for
    you as the operator, thereby increasing privacy and reducing legal risks
1. Peer-to-peer capable
  - Reduce costs by allowing some data to be transferred directly between users
