# Background
The various aspects discussed herein relate to storing and distributing information over computer systems. Existing methods and systems in this field exhibit various problems, including problems relating to resilience against adverse conditions, deliberate attacks or censorship. Accordingly, there is a need for improvement.

# Brief Summary
The present invention describes a method for storing and/or distributing information over computer systems in a resilient manner. Embodiments of present invention may be of arbitrary size and number, may span arbitrary amounts of physical distance and network boundaries as long as network connectivity exists, such networks being or not being homogenous in structure and/or capacity.

In its preferred embodiments, present invention allows the resilience of its data storage and/or distribution facilities to surpass the resilience of the underlying computer systems, in preferred embodiments by guaranteeing that information integrity will be preserved and information will eventually be available on every single node in the network. Preferred embodiments will overcome temporary loss of connectivity and will allow information to eventually penetrate lossy, instable, temporarily unavailable or other hard-to-reach areas of the underlying computer network(s), even if errors in such networks may corrupt data in transit.

Further preferred embodiments allow for easy setup requiring no further information than the address of one other node participating in the network.

In one embodiment, information is handled in blocks of data of fixed size, with such size to be chosen on inception. Such embodiment may further increase performance and/or resilience and is preferred if data naturally occurs in similarly sized chunks or can be efficiently transformed into one or multiple chunks of such fixed size.
