# Preliminary considerations
## Problem-Solution statements
| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| Servers, no matter whether fully centralized or federated, can fail, cost money to buy and operate, are prominent attack targets, can have their network access curtailed either at the server end or by inclusion in client-side blocklists, and can be shut down or ordered to shut down by third parties | Fully decentralized information storage and exchange |
| Identity information stored on a server can be stolen and manipulated | Fully decentralized identities based on public key cryptography |
| Identity information stored on the client device cannot easily be used on a different device | Storing private identity information on the decentralized network in a cryptographically secure way |
| p2p networks are hard to join & use | Fully automatic bootstrap and node exchange only requiring knowledge of a single other node |

# Patent draft

## Background
The various aspects discussed herein relate to storing and distributing information over computer systems. Existing methods and systems in this field exhibit various problems, including problems relating to resilience against adverse conditions, deliberate attacks or censorship. Accordingly, there is a need for improvement.

## Brief Summary
The present invention describes methods, apparatuses and computer software embodied in a computer-readable medium for storing, transmitting and/or distributing information over computer systems in a resilient manner. Embodiments of present invention may be used to facilitate such resilient storing, trasmitting and/or distributing of information over computer systems spanning arbitrary amounts of physical distance and network boundaries as long as network connectivity exists, such networks being or not being homogenous in structure and/or capacity.

In its preferred embodiments, present invention allows the resilience of its data storage and/or distribution facilities to surpass the resilience of the underlying computer systems, in further preferred embodiments by guaranteeing that information integrity will be preserved and information will eventually be available on every single node in the network. Preferred embodiments will overcome temporary loss of connectivity and will allow information to eventually penetrate lossy, instable, temporarily unavailable or other hard-to-reach areas of the underlying computer network or networks, even if errors in such networks may corrupt data in transit.

Further preferred embodiments allow for easy setup requiring no further information than the network address of one other node participating in the network.

In one embodiment, information is handled in blocks of data of fixed size, with such size to be chosen on inception. Such embodiment may further increase performance and/or resilience and is preferred if data naturally occurs in similarly sized chunks or can be efficiently transformed into one or multiple chunks of such fixed size.
